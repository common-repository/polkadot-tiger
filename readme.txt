= What is SEO A/B Metadata Testing? =

SEO A/B Metadata testing is an SEO & CRO strategy which aims to find the optimum Metadata for any webpage in order to understand and improve both Rankings and Click Through Rates.

The goal of SEO A/B Metadata testing is to get squeeze every ounce of performance out of your current rankings and possibly to improve them a little at the same time. A higher CTR for the same Ranking means more traffic on your website. Other benefits include Google considering new Metadata as fresh content meaning it is easier than ever before keep Google coming back to your site regularly to check for updates.

If your Metadata can stand out from the other SERP rankings, then not only will you see higher Click Through Rates.


= How does the SEO Metadata A/B Testing work? =

It’s really quite simple! Instead of writing one Metadata variation on a webpage, you write two or even three (or four if you like to walk on the wild side!).

You note the date you start uploading the first variation and take down the current page ranking and Click-Through Rate for your desired keywords as a baseline performance index. You then leave the variation for X amount of time, usually 10-14 days, to allow Google to index the new variation and to collect the necessary data to understand the impact your new metadata variation has on the page’s on positions and CTR.

Once this is complete, you repeat the process with the test’s remaining variations. Once all of the variations have been completed, you can collate and compare the data results and find the optimum variation which has the best rankings and CTR rates.
